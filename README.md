Project 05: File Metadata Microservice
======================================

User Stories:
------------

1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.

2. The input field of the form file must have the "name" attribute set to "upfile".
   
3. When I submit a file a JSON response is returned containing the file name and its size in bytes.

4. To handle the file uploading you should use the [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) npm package.


### Example usage:
* Upload a file using the form provided in the app.
